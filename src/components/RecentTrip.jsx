Soak up the sophisticated, metropolitan buzz of Paris, relax into the slower-paced charms of Provence, or unwind completely and indulge in the leisurely joys of a cruise along the RhÃ´ne."

            text="Historically,[2] the areas adjacent to the rivers were the first to be populated. Thus, most communities in Thailand were built at the sides of rivers. The waterways served as means of transportation and the center of economic activity, as well. Boats were mainly used for local and regional trade, bringing goods from those that produced to those that could barter and trade. Such ways of life of the riverside communities, especially in the Chao Phraya River Basin, increased the number of floating markets."
